# LiDarMaps

Functions used to read and understand raw data from the Neato XV-11 LiDAR (typically found in Roomba vaccuum cleaners). These functions were written as part of a mini pilot project where we wanted to mount LiDARs on UAVs for detecting objects in close range for indoor navigation. The raw data can also be exported and plotted for a nice view of the room's walls.
